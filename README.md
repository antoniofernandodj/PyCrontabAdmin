This is a experiment to run flask with an architecture similar to MVT of Django, where we find three majoy layers, so to speak.

1. The first layer with the responsability to register the urls, what their names and what functions they call;
2. The second layer with the responsability to define the design of the database and how to handle the sql tables;
3. The last layer responsible to handle each request and what to query from database and what to send to the front end.
